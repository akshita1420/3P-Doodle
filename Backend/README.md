IMPLEMENTING SUPABASE OAUTH LOGIN

 THE SERVER ACTS AS A RESOURCE SERVER RATHER THAN AN AUTHENTICATION SERVER , SO ALL THE TOKEN LOGIC AND REFRESH LOGIC IS HANDELED BY SUPABASE , JUST THE JWT TOKEN PROVIDED BY SUPABASE AFTER THE REDIRECT WILL BE PASSED TO THE FRONTEND AND ON EACH REQUEST, IT WOULD BE SENT AS AN AUTHENTICATION BEARER HEADER. USING THE "GLOBAL JWT" something that needs to be looked into for implementation, basically it get the key from supabase and validates the jwt then allows api serving.
